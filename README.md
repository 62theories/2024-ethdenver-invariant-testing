# Invariant Fuzz Testing Presentation and Code

## What is this and whoami
This repo is built for a talk I am giving at EthDenver 2024 to explain what invariant fuzz testing is and show how to use it with [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/invariant-testing).

I am an independent security research who works with clients through invariant test engineering, security reviews and protocol/technical advising.

Formerly, I was a (pre-endgame) Senior Protocol Engineer with MakerDAO, a Maker Foundation Smart Contract Engineer (securing and launching MCD), and a Backend and Smart Contract Engineer with ConsenSys.

I can be found on the internet occassionally on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamchrissmith), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamchrisryansmith/), at my [business website](https://lefthandcypher.com/) and, of course, here on [GitHub](https://github.com/iamchrissmith).

**Note:** All code in this repo is for demonstration purposes only

DAI code has been updated slighlty to be compatible with Solidity 0.8 and Foundry.
